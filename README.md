<!-- ## Introduction

This repository includes various coding exercises, projects, and applications to help strengthen Python development skills. You'll find both simple and complex projects based on real-world problems, as well as solutions to algorithmic challenges.

- **Python**: Covers everything from basic syntax to object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms.
- **Django**: Web development using Django for building scalable and secure web applications.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework projects for building simple REST APIs or small web applications.
- **Data Science**: Projects involving data analysis, data cleaning, machine learning, and deep learning with libraries like `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, and `TensorFlow`.

## Coding Challenges

This section contains various algorithmic challenges, including problems from **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **Codewars**, and other platforms. Each solution is organized by difficulty and includes a brief description of the problem, the solution approach, and code implementation.

### Examples:

- **Two Sum**: Solution for the "Two Sum" problem from LeetCode.
- **FizzBuzz**: Basic loop challenge demonstrating conditional statements in Python.
- **Merge Sort**: Implementing the Merge Sort algorithm.

You can find all the challenges under the `coding-challenges/` directory.

## Python Projects

This section showcases a range of general Python projects, including utilities, data manipulation, and other real-world applications.

### General Python Projects

- **CLI Calculator**: A command-line interface (CLI) calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Todo List App**: A Python app for managing tasks and reminders, saved in a local file or SQLite database.
- **Weather App**: Fetching real-time weather data using a public API like OpenWeatherMap.

These projects can be found in the `python-projects/` folder.

### Django Projects

This folder contains web development projects using Django, a high-level Python web framework.

- **Blog Application**: A basic blog platform allowing users to create, edit, and delete posts.
- **E-Commerce Site**: A simple e-commerce website with product listings, a shopping cart, and checkout functionality.
- **Authentication System**: A Django app demonstrating user authentication (signup, login, password reset, etc.).

The Django projects are available in the `django-projects/` folder.

### Flask Projects

Flask is a lightweight web framework, and here you'll find projects demonstrating its capabilities.

- **REST API**: A simple RESTful API built with Flask that handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **User Authentication API**: A Flask app implementing JWT-based authentication for a REST API.
- **Blog API**: A backend for a blog platform using Flask and SQLite, featuring post creation and comment functionality.

The Flask projects are under the `flask-projects/` directory.

## Data Science Projects

This section includes projects related to data science, from data manipulation to machine learning models.

- **Titanic Survival Prediction**: A machine learning model using the Titanic dataset to predict survival chances.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: A time series analysis and prediction model using historical stock prices.
- **Customer Segmentation**: K-means clustering to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.

These projects can be found in the `data-science-projects/` folder. -->
